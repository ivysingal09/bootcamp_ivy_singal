    "# Stage 1 – Problem Framing & Scoping\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement  \n",
    "Credit risk assessment is a critical function in the financial industry. Traditional models often rely heavily on limited credit bureau data, which may fail to capture the true financial behavior of borrowers—particularly those who are new to credit or come from underserved segments. As a result, institutions face higher default risks, while many potential borrowers are unfairly excluded from access to credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to design an enhanced credit risk modeling system that integrates both traditional credit data and alternative data sources (e.g., transaction history, spending behavior, employment records). By applying advanced machine learning techniques, the system will classify borrowers more accurately, enabling financial institutions to manage risk better while promoting financial inclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Scope  \n",
    "The project scope includes:  \n",
    "- Collecting and preprocessing structured (credit bureau, transaction records) and unstructured (employment, behavioral) data.  \n",
    "- Developing machine learning models that balance predictive accuracy with interpretability and fairness.  \n",
    "- Evaluating models using metrics that account not only for accuracy, but also fairness and regulatory compliance.  \n",
    "- Delivering actionable insights for credit analysts, loan officers, and decision-makers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Out of scope:  \n",
    "- Deployment of the final model into live banking systems.  \n",
    "- Building customer-facing lending applications.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Success Criteria  \n",
    "- **Improved Predictive Power**: Demonstrated uplift in accuracy and AUC compared to baseline models.  \n",
    "- **Fairness Metrics**: Models evaluated on bias and fairness to ensure equitable treatment of borrowers.  \n",
    "- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Outputs align with the needs of risk teams, analysts, and regulatory expectations.  \n",
    "- **Scalability**: System designed to handle large datasets and expand across geographies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints & Risks  \n",
    "- **Data Access**: Alternative data may be restricted due to privacy regulations.  \n",
    "- **Regulatory Compliance**: Must adhere to transparency and explainability requirements.  \n",
    "- **Bias Risk**: Use of sensitive data could inadvertently reinforce systemic bias if not managed carefully.  \n",
    "- **Resource Constraints**: Limited time for model development and stakeholder engagement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Impact  \n",
    "By enhancing credit risk modeling, this project aims to:  \n",
    "- Reduce default rates and improve loan portfolio performance.  \n",
    "- Expand fair access to credit, particularly for underserved populations.  \n",
    "- Strengthen institutional reputation for fairness and innovation.  \n",
    "- Support regulators’ objectives of transparency and systemic stability.  "

    "## Overview  \n",
    "This memo summarizes the scope of our proposed project: enhancing credit risk modeling with richer data inputs and advanced machine learning techniques. The aim is to improve borrower risk classification, reduce defaults, and expand fair access to credit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Stakeholders  \n",
    "- **Risk Management Teams** – Require accurate, data-driven models to assess borrower risk.  \n",
    "- **Loan Officers & Credit Analysts** – Depend on outputs for operational approvals and denials.  \n",
    "- **Fintech Product Teams** – Interested in creating new lending products for emerging segments.  \n",
    "- **Borrowers** – Benefit from fairer credit access and improved loan pricing.  \n",
    "- **Regulators** – Ensure compliance, transparency, and systemic stability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Benefits  \n",
    "- **Reduced Default Rates** – Better borrower segmentation lowers non-performing loans.  \n",
    "- **Increased Market Reach** – Access to new and underserved customer bases.  \n",
    "- **Regulatory Alignment** – Models built with fairness and explainability.  \n",
    "- **Reputation & Trust** – Institutions adopting fairer models enhance their credibility.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps  \n",
    "1. Identify and secure datasets (transactional, behavioral, traditional credit).  \n",
    "2. Define evaluation metrics (accuracy, fairness, explainability).  \n",
    "3. Draft a timeline for iterative model development and stakeholder review.  \n",
    "\n",
