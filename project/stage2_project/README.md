# Stage 2 — Tooling Setup

## Environment & Tools
- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis  
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub for tracking progress  
- **Dependencies:** Managed via `requirements.txt` (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn)  

## Folder Usage
- **data/raw/** → for original housing data (CSV, Excel, etc.)  
- **data/processed/** → for cleaned / transformed datasets  
- **notebooks/** → for exploration & analysis in Jupyter  
- **src/** → for reusable functions and scripts  
- **docs/** → for reports, figures, or documentation  

## Notes
This setup ensures all team members use the same structure and tools. Data is separated into raw vs. processed, notebooks are for analysis steps, and reusable code lives in `src/`.
