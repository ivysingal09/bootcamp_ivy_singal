# Stage 1 — Problem Framing & Scoping
## Project: Forecasting House Price Trends for Better Investment Decisions

## Short Project Summary (1–2 paragraphs)
Real estate is one of the largest investment classes, yet buyers and investors often struggle to anticipate price movements. Poor forecasts can lead to overpaying for a property, missing high-growth areas, or holding assets that underperform. This project aims to analyze historical housing price data to identify trends and patterns, giving investors and homebuyers a clearer view of where prices may be headed.

The first version will explore price trends by location, property size, and time horizon. Using historical sales and economic indicators (like interest rates and inflation), the project will provide insights on neighborhoods or segments with faster growth versus stagnation. Success means improving decision-making for investors and buyers — helping them allocate capital more confidently.
